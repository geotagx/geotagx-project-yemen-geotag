This module was created for UNITAR Operational Satellite Applications Programme's (UNOSAT) assistance to the international relief agency [ACTED](http://www.acted.org), in mapping agricultural areas of the Raymah division of Yemen to help improve water use.

Much of this work has been done with satellite imagery, but photographs or videos of agricultural areas and practices in or near the Raymah division of Yemen were also valuable.

Right now this project has few images, so if you have seen relevant media, you can [use the Geotag-X firefox plugin](http://geotagx.org/#find_photos) to share relevant media.

Local knowledge of Raymah is valuable for geotagging photos in this module.

Media about coffee or qat (also spelt khat) crops in the area are particularly relevant, as well as any assessment of soil conditions or drought stress. This PDF [report about coffee production](http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/REACH_coffee_value_chain_assessment_in_Raymah_governorate_Yemen.pdf) is a related research outcome.
